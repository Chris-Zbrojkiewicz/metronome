# The Metronome

The Metronome is a browser-based timing tool designed for musicians who want precise, reliable tempo control during practice. It supports adjustable BPM and subdivisions to accommodate different practice styles and rhythms. The project was built to explore accurate audio scheduling in the browser and predictable state management for time-sensitive interactions.
